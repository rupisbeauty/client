Dermaplaning is a non-invasive procedure that uses a scalpel to gently exfoliate the skin. This procedure is great for those who are looking to improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, acne scarring, hyperpigmentation, and sun damage. Dermaplaning is also a great way to improve the overall texture and tone of the skin.
