Microdermabrasion is a non-invasive procedure that uses a diamond tip wand to gently exfoliate the skin. This procedure is great for those who are looking to improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, acne scarring, hyperpigmentation, and sun damage. Microdermabrasion is also a great way to improve the overall texture and tone of the skin.
