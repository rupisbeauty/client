LED light therapy is a non-invasive procedure that uses light to stimulate collagen production and kill bacteria. This procedure is great for those who are looking to improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, acne scarring, hyperpigmentation, and sun damage. LED light therapy is also a great way to improve the overall texture and tone of the skin.
