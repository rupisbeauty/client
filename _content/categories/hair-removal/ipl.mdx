title: Intense Pulse Light (IPL) Hair Removal
description: Intense Pulse Light (IPL) Hair Removal technology provides a non-invasive treatment option that uses a broad spectrum of light to effectively remove hair from the body. The light is absorbed by the pigment in the hair follicle, which is then destroyed. IPL is a safe and effective treatment for hair removal, and is suitable for most skin types.
disclaimer:
  - There is an additional charge of a minimum of $25 if we are required to shave any area prior to service.
  - IPL may not be an effective method of hair removal for people with darker skin tones. This is because darker skin tones have more melanin, which absorbs the light. If this impacts you, feel free to ask us about our other hair removal options.
  - IPL is also not recommended for people with a history of skin cancer.
