title: Intense Pulse Light (IPL) Hair Removal
description: >-
  Intense Pulse Light (IPL) Hair Removal technology provides a non-invasive
  treatment option that uses a broad spectrum of light to effectively remove
  hair from the body. The light is absorbed by the pigment in the hair follicle,
  which is then destroyed. IPL is a safe and effective treatment for hair
  removal, and is suitable for most skin types. The heat energy from the Intense
  Pulse Light treatment also stimulates the production of collagen and elastin,
  which helps to improve the skin’s texture and tone as well as reduce the
  appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and other damaging signs of aging. The
  treatment itself is generally short and fuss-free, and some of the results may
  even provide permanent results.

    There is an additional charge of a minimum of $25 if we are required to
    shave any area prior to service.

    IPL may not be an effective method of hair removal for people with darker
    skin tones. This is because darker skin tones have more melanin, which
    absorbs the light. If this impacts you, feel free to ask us about our other
    hair removal options.
  - IPL is also not recommended for people with a history of skin cancer.
