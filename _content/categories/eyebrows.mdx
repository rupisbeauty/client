      A facial is a cosmetic procedure in which the skin on the face is cleaned,
      exfoliated, and moisturized. For the procedure, our trained Estheticians
      will then cleanse your skin and possibly use a gentle exfoliant to remove
      dead skin cells. They may use steaming or hot towels to open up pores for
      extractions (removal of blackheads or whiteheads).

      Some of the benefits of a facial include cleansing the skin, reducing
      acne, and improving the overall health of the skin. For teens, getting a
      facial helps teach proper skin care techniques.
