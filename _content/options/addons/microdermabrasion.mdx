description: >-
  Microdermabrasion is a non-invasive procedure that uses a diamond tip wand to
  gently exfoliate the skin. This procedure is great for those who are looking
  to improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, acne scarring,
  hyperpigmentation, and sun damage. Microdermabrasion is also a great way to
  improve the overall texture and tone of the skin.
