title: Acne Reduction Facial
description: >-
  Acne facials reduce the symptoms of Acne breakouts by deep pore cleaning of blackheads and white heads. Our professional esthetician will then cleanse your skin and apply products such as exfoliants, serums, and masks that contain ingredients such as salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids. Some of the benefits of an acne reduction facial include reducing the appearance of acne, blackheads, whiteheads, and blemishes, unclogging pores, reducing oil production, and reducing inflammation of the skin.
disclaimer:
  - In some cases, allergic reactions to the solution may occur. There may also be some irritation and redness around the skin of the eyebrows if your skin is very sensitive. Please feel free to consult with our estheticians to find the best option for your skin care needs.
