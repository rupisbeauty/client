title: Dermaplaning
description: >-
  Dermaplaning is a non-invasive procedure that uses a scalpel to gently
  exfoliate the skin. This procedure is great for those who are looking to
  improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, acne scarring,
  hyperpigmentation, and sun damage. Dermaplaning is also a great way to improve
  the overall texture and tone of the skin.
